Company of Choice : AEye LiDar

Dear AEye Team,
I am Saiharan Rajkumar, mailing you on behalf of "TEAM ABHIYAAN" from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
Our vision is to create an autonomous navigation system to negate human risk and assist humans in other activities. We are constantly looking for real life scenarios to apply this technology and solve them. Having tasted success in competitions across the globe, we are hoping to achieve greater heights by working on Autonomous vehicles of larger scale. The team will strive and move forwards towards its vision of creating autonomous systems that help solve real life problems.

We believe that it would be extremely supportive if your company would sponsor us in our upcoming endeavours. AEye's LiDar technology is one of the best in the market, and having access to it would significantly increase the quality of the team's work and products. We also believe that our application would bring more light to AEye's technologies on a global scale, given our success at previous global events.

We request you to kindly look into this, and acknowledge the receival of this email.

Best Regards
Saiharan Rajkumar
Team Abhiyaan
