Please note that the code contains multiple commented lines of code, which are all a different approach of solving the physics behind the question. Even after putting in extended hours, none of the logics seemed to give the answer. <br>
I have included all the attempts, please look through it<br>
barebones.py is the matplot version of the solution, using force equations<br>
The primary method in the turtlesim assumes same mass, in order to have same linear and angular velocity at all moments, and follows with conservation of energy and angular momentum to calculate the linear tangential speed and angular velocity.<br>
<br>
Steps to run it,<br>
roscore<br>
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node<br>
bash rosturtle.sh<br>
rosrun task3a 3a.py
